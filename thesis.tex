% SUMMARY HERE (300 word limit for most subjects):
This dissertation addresses four questions on political and criminal violence. The first essay is an empirical evaluation of a broad set of homicide reduction policies implemented in the state of S達o Paulo, Brazil. I employ the synthetic control method, a generalisation of differences-in-differences, to compare these measures against an artificial S達o Paulo. The results indicate a large drop in homicide rates in actual S達o Paulo when contrasted with the synthetic counterfactual, with about 20,000 lives saved during the period. 

The second essay offers a rational choice account for the Brazil's \textit{jogo do bicho}, or the `animal game', possibly the largest illegal gambling game in the world. I investigate the institutions that have caused the \textit{jogo do bicho}'s notable growth and long-term survival outside the boundaries of the Brazilian law. I show how \textit{bicheiros} or bookmakers promote social order, solve information asymmetries, and reduce negative externalities via costly signalling and the provision of club goods. I also explain the emergence of the informal rules that govern the game as well as their enforcement mechanisms. 

The third essay, co-authored with Gary Uzonyi, presents a meta-analysis of the determinants of government-sponsored violence. We employ traditional meta-analysis estimators and Bayesian meta-regressions with random and fixed effects to a set of 48 articles published in the last 20 years to evaluate the main predictors of mass killing onset. 

The fourth essay, co-authored with Umberto Mignozzetti, examines the specific mechanisms by which the \textit{Primeiro Comando da Capital} (PCC), a Brazilian prison gang,  has helped reduce violence in S達o Paulo. We address this gap by proposing a survey experiment to evaluate three competing mechanisms that might have plausibly caused the drop in homicides, namely economic welfare, protection against police harassment, and the local provision of law and order.Our main hypothesis is that the PCC proposed a cohesive system of law and order by informally securing property rights and solving conflicts through credible threats and a local monopoly of the use of force.
